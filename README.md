# OmniFoods

A healthy food service website

The website is a savoury website for a company that offers food delivery to people
who  do not have time ti cook for themselves.

The website is based on grid system , with some jquery animations.It is mainly built 
up from the base on HTML and CSS. It doesnt not use any external theme extracts.

This Omnifood design is made as per shown in Jonas Schmedtmann's course. My focus here was not on the animations but on the html css teechniques applied here to make this website.This can act as an very useful theme design for other products as well.
